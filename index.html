                Currently, there are nation states and individual actors who intercept and store encrypted data
                containing sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, and social security numbers.
                Although they cannot decrypt these files at the moment, they believe that within the next 10 to 20
                years, quantum computers will be able to break the encryption quickly. This practice is referred to
                as Store Now, Decrypt Later (SNDL). The reason behind this is that certain information available
                today will still be valuable in the future, including industrial and pharmaceutical research as well
                as top-secret government intelligence.
                <br><br>
                The National Security Administration acknowledges the threat posed by quantum computers, stating
                that a sufficiently large quantum computer could undermine widely used public key algorithms. The
                U.S. Congress has recently passed legislation requiring government agencies to transition to new
                cryptographic methods that cannot be broken by quantum computers.
                <br><br>
                To understand the current encryption methods, it's helpful to look back at their history. In the
                past, if two parties wanted to exchange private information, they would meet in person and share a
                secret key. This method, known as asymmetric key algorithm, ensured the security of messages as long
                as the key remained private. However, with the need to send information to unfamiliar recipients or
                over unsecured channels like phone lines or mail, a new encryption breakthrough was necessary.
                <br><br>
                In 1977, three scientists named Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman devised an encryption system called RSA.
                It involved each individual having two large prime numbers, which they kept secret. These numbers
                were multiplied to obtain an even larger number, which was made public. To send a private message,
                the sender would use the recipient's public number to encrypt the message in a way that only the two
                prime factors could decrypt it. This system, called asymmetric key system, allowed secure
                communication without the need for a shared key.
                <br><br>
                Quantum computers have the potential to break the encryption methods used in RSA and other public
                key cryptography. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can represent either 0 or 1,
                quantum computers use qubits that can exist in a superposition of states. This means that quantum
                computers can perform multiple calculations simultaneously, leading to exponentially faster
                computations. However, reading the results from a superposition is challenging, and extracting the
                desired information requires complex techniques. Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith developed a quantum
                algorithm in 1994 called the quantum Fourier transform, which allows for extracting frequency
                information from a periodic superposition. Read more about Quantum Fourier Transform
                <a href="https://www.qutube.nl/quantum-algorithms/quantum-fourier-transform"><u>here</u></a>. This
                process can
                lead to the
                discovery of the prime factors of N, even for large numbers, which would be impractical for
                classical computers.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, although quantum computers have the potential to break current encryption methods,
                their practical implementation is still years away. However, the threat of "Store Now, Decrypt
                Later" practices has prompted the U.S. Congress to pass legislation mandating the adoption of
                quantum-resistant cryptographic methods. The history and principles of encryption, as well as the
                specific challenges and opportunities presented by quantum computers, highlight the need for robust
                and future-proof cryptographic techniques.
